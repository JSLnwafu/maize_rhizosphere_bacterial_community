Experimental design
The filed-trial experiment was started in April 2017 and had three treatments: (1) control (CK, no P fertilizer added); (2) farmers’ practice (FP, 120 kg P2O5 ha−1 yr−1 (single superphosphate, containing P2O5 16.0%)); and (3) reduced P fertilizer input (RP, 70 kg P2O5 ha−1 yr−1, balanced P fertilization based on P balance and soil P (Ma et al. 2020) ). Each treatment had three plots and each plot had a size of 4 m × 6 m. All the three treatments also received N fertilizer (160 kg N ha−1 yr−1, urea, N 46%) and potassium (K) fertilizer (90 kg K2O ha−1 yr−1, potassium sulfate, K2O 50%). The total of P and K and half of the N fertilizers were incorporated to 10 cm soil layer prior to maize sowing. Another half of the N fertilizer was topdressed at the jointing stage of maize. The spring maize (Zea mays L. cv. Xianyu 335) was grown from May to September under rainfed conditions. Maize was sown using film mulching at a density of 65 thousand plants per hectare in late April and harvested in late September. Maize straws were removed from the field, and weeds were manually removed. The period of Octember to April is the fallow season when no crop is grown.
Soil sampling and analyzing
At the V3 to V5 spring maize stages (on May 28, June 9 and June 18, 2019), 27 rhizosphere soil (RS) samples (9 samples per stage) were collected from the plots of the three treatments using the shake method that detailed in the description of Ran et al. (2021). The soil nitrate N and ammonium N, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, soil pH, available P (Olsen P) were determined.
Sequencing
The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified with the primers 515F and 806R.

Data was collected in Shaanxi, China in 2019.
